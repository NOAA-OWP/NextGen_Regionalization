Notes about streamflow signatures:

1. The following scripts related streamflow signature calculations were copied directly from NWMv3 regionalization
and can be adapted easily for use in NextGen regionalization

download_qme_usgs.R
process_gage_record.R
derive_streamflow_signatures.R
plot_streamflow_signatures.R

2. The script derive_streamflow_signatures.R uses a few functions from "../func", also directly copied from NWMv3 regionalization
